# Sorting_Algorithms_Performance_Comparison

## Overview
This project evaluates the performance of several sorting algorithms in Java: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Counting Sort, and Bubble Sort. Each algorithm is tested under different conditions such as sorting random arrays and pre-sorted arrays.

## Usage
To run the comparisons, simply execute the Sorting.java file. The results will be plotted using the Plotter library, showing the average execution times of each algorithm across varying input sizes.

## Algorithms Implemented
  - Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n).
  - Merge Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm with a stable O(n log n) time complexity.
  - Counting Sort: Suitable for sorting integers with a time complexity of O(n + k), where k is the range of the input.
  - Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2).
  - Quick Select: Finds the k-th smallest element in an unordered list, with an average time complexity of O(n).

## Requirements
1. Java Development Kit (JDK)
2. Plotter library for visualization (included)
