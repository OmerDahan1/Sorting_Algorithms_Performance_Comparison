# Sorting_Algorithms_Performance_Comparison
This project compares various sorting algorithms—quick sort, merge sort, counting sort, and bubble sort—across different scenarios such as random arrays, pre-sorted arrays, and more. It includes implementations in Java and visualizations of algorithm performance metrics using Plotter.
